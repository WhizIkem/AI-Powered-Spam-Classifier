## AI-Powered SMS Spam Classifier

This project builds a machine learning system that detects whether an SMS message is spam or not spam.
The goal is to improve user safety by blocking unwanted or fraudulent messages.
This project was completed as part of a LinkedIn Learning hands-on project, and the dataset used was provided by SkillUp.

The work done in this project includes:
- Loading and exploring the SMS spam dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing the text data
- Converting messages into numeric features using TF-IDF
- Training and testing different machine learning models
- Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Using advanced NLP models such as BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa
- Comparing traditional ML models with transformer-based models
- Using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance

Models used in this project:
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Multi-layer Perceptron
- Transformer embeddings + Logistic Regression
- Transformer embeddings + XGBoost

Best results:
BERT + Logistic Regression gave the best overall performance with high accuracy, strong recall, and excellent F1-score.
TF-IDF + XGBoost also achieved strong performance as a traditional machine learning model.

Tools and technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Transformers (Hugging Face), PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook.

To run:
Install Python libraries and open the notebooks in Jupyter. Run the notebooks step by step to see the full workflow.

This project shows practical skills in NLP, machine learning, data preparation, model training, evaluation, and problem solving.
